# MBoutique

## Assignment
> To build out the full MBoutique (a fictional company's) website

# WHAT WAS LEARNED
>   Having just learned how to create basic web sites with HTML/CSS without any sort of libraries or outside help,
> this was a very big test of my ability to keep trying to hammer a page to meet specifications. Specific things I learned:
> included using the dev tools/element inspector to examine the page, manipulate the page, and to be careful about
> use and placement of CSS selectors.
>   Now that I have been away from the project for a while, I intend to return to remake it with improvements.

# TO DO
> I'll think of something

# ADDITIONAL FEATURES ADDED
> Remake with Bootstrap CSS
> Remake with AngularJS routing - pull content from template file
